## Introduction to Hangul

Hangul, the native alphabet of the Korean writing system, is renowned for its logical and systematic design. Created during the 15th century under the rule of King Sejong the Great, Hangul consists of consonants, vowels, double consonants, and double vowels that form syllabic blocks. Understanding the structure of Hangul is essential for navigating the Hangul Learning App.

### Characters and Reading

1. **Consonants:**
   - Basic consonants are written in a square shape, representing sounds. There are 14 basic consonants:
     - ㄱ (g/k), ㄴ (n), ㄷ (d/t), ㄹ (l/r), ㅁ (m), ㅂ (b/p), ㅅ (s), ㅇ (ng), ㅈ (j), ㅊ (ch), ㅋ (k), ㅌ (t), ㅍ (p), ㅎ (h).

2. **Double Consonants:**
   - Some consonants can be doubled to create stronger sounds:
     - ㄲ (kk), ㄸ (tt), ㅃ (pp), ㅆ (ss), ㅉ (jj).

3. **Vowels:**
   - Vowels are written in a circular or square shape, indicating distinct sounds. There are 10 basic vowels:
     - ㅏ (a), ㅑ (ya), ㅓ (eo), ㅕ (yeo), ㅗ (o), ㅛ (yo), ㅜ (u), ㅠ (yu), ㅡ (eu), ㅣ (i).

4. **Double Vowels:**
   - Some vowels can be doubled to create a combined sound:
     - ㅐ (ae), ㅒ (yae), ㅔ (e), ㅖ (ye), ㅘ (wa), ㅙ (wae), ㅚ (oe), ㅝ (wo), ㅞ (we), ㅟ (wi), ㅢ (ui).

5. **Final Consonants:**
   - Final consonants, appearing at the bottom of a syllable block, modify pronunciation. There are 28 final consonants, including an empty consonant (no final consonant).

 a correct Romanized answer:

1. **Observation:**
   - Identify the individual Hangul character, in this case: ㅂ (b) 'initial', ㅣ (i) 'vowel', ㅌ (t) 'final'.

2. **Romanization:**
   - Romanize each character: ㅂ (b) + ㅣ (i) + ㅌ (t) = "bit."

3. **Input:**
   - Enter the Romanized version "bit" in the input field on the web interface.

4. **Verification:**
   - Click the "Check" button to verify your answer.

5. **Feedback:**
