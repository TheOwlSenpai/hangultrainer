Hangul, the native alphabet of the Korean writing system, is renowned for its logical and systematic design. Created during the 15th century under the rule of King Sejong the Great, Hangul consists of consonants, vowels, double consonants, and double vowels that form syllabic blocks.

### Characters and Reading

1. **Initial Consonants:**
   - Basic consonants are written in a square shape and represent sounds. There are 14 basic consonants, including:
     - ㄱ (g/k), ㄴ (n), ㄷ (d/t), ㄹ (l/r), ㅁ (m), ㅂ (b/p), ㅅ (s), ㅇ (ng), ㅈ (j), ㅊ (ch), ㅋ (k), ㅌ (t), ㅍ (p), ㅎ (h).
   - Double Consonants: ㄲ (kk), ㄸ (tt), ㅃ (pp), ㅆ (ss), ㅉ (jj).

2. **Medial Vowels:**
   - Vowels are written in a circular or square shape and indicate distinct sounds. There are 20 basic vowels, including:
     - ㅏ (a), ㅑ (ya), ㅓ (eo), ㅕ (yeo), ㅗ (o), ㅛ (yo), ㅜ (u), ㅠ (yu), ㅡ (eu), ㅣ (i), ㅐ (ae), ㅒ (yae), ㅔ (e), ㅖ (ye), ㅘ (wa), ㅙ (wae), ㅚ (oi), ㅝ (wo), ㅞ (we), ㅟ (wi), ㅢ (ui).
   - Double Vowels: ㅑ (yya), ㅕ (yyeo), ㅛ (yyo), ㅠ (yyu), ㅖ (yey).

3. **Final Consonants:**
   - Final consonants, appearing at the bottom of a syllable block, modify the pronunciation. There are 28 final consonants, including an empty consonant (no final consonant):
     - ' ' (no sound), ㄱ (g), ㄲ (kk), ㄳ (gs), ㄴ (n), ㄵ (nj), ㄶ (nh), ㄷ (d), ㄹ (l), ㄺ (lg), ㄻ (lm), ㄼ (lb), ㄽ (ls), ㄾ (lt), ㄿ (lp), ㅀ (lh), ㅁ (m), ㅂ (b), ㅄ (bs), ㅅ (s), ㅆ (ss), ㅇ (ng), ㅈ (j), ㅊ (ch), ㅋ (k), ㅌ (t), ㅍ (p), ㅎ (h).

4. **Combination Examples:**
   - Syllables are formed by combining an initial consonant, a medial vowel, and an optional final consonant. For instance:
     - Basic: 가 (ga), 나 (na), 다 (da), 라 (la), 마 (ma), 바 (ba), 사 (sa), 아 (a).
     - Complex: 갈 (gal), 날 (nal), 달 (dal), 랄 (ral), 말 (mal), 발 (bal), 살 (sal), 알 (al).

Suppose the generated Hangul word is "한" (han). Here's how you can provide a correct Romanized answer:

1. **Observation:**
   - Identify the individual Hangul characters: ㅎ initial, ㅏ vowel, ㄴ final.

2. **Romanization:**
   - Romanize each character: ㅎ (h) + ㅏ (a) + ㄴ (n) = "han."

3. **Input:**
   - Enter the Romanized version "han" in the input field on the web interface.

4. **Verification:**
   - Click the "Check" button to verify your answer.

5. **Feedback:**
   - If correct, the app will confirm your accuracy. If incorrect, the app will prompt you to try again.
